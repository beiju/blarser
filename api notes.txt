these are all observed in gamma9 and not checked in other eras

- snowfall events aren't visible in player entities until some time after they happen
- standings changes likewise, and also "wins" and "losses" will update before of "runs" and "gamesPlayed", but only for the winner of the game
- i think the initialization of the snowfallEvents field (but not subsequent updates) is also delayed, but it might just be that i don't understand what causes it to be initialized
- consecutiveHits went up for this home run: https://reblase.sibr.dev/game/018f094a-ffa1-4173-b4bb-378577094358#5a8e03a5-0045-f766-f79b-4ded89a70767
- teams winStreak will flicker between 0 and the true value for some time after the game ends
    - also winStreak decrements when a team loses instead of being reset to 0 as the name implies
- this gameUpdate is timestamped significantly later than the updates that surround it https://reblase.sibr.dev/game/ac68c433-9981-4264-83dc-1ba12f3b3fa4#376cdcee-379a-5c83-d0e0-12cd138f4498
