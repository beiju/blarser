these are all observed in gamma9 and not checked in other eras

- "<player name> scored!" events should have their own event type. Currently, they re-use the Hit event type if the run
  was scored off a hit, ground out, or flyout and the Walk event type if it was scored off a walk (I haven't looked at
  any other scoring situations, like blaserunning).
- I inferred this from looking at Chron records so the details might not be quite right, but the general idea is. After
  each game on the first day of gamma9 ended, the team object from the polling API updated correctly but the one in
  streamData stayed at 0. I have not checked if this happened in any other seasons. (Also, winStreak is a bit misleading
  as a name because it also tracks the loss streak using a negative number.)

TODO Re-verify all these
- snowfall events aren't visible in player entities until some time after they happen
- standings changes likewise, and also "wins" and "losses" will update before of "runs" and "gamesPlayed", but only for the winner of the game
- consecutiveHits went up for this home run: https://reblase.sibr.dev/game/018f094a-ffa1-4173-b4bb-378577094358#5a8e03a5-0045-f766-f79b-4ded89a70767
- this gameUpdate is timestamped significantly later than the updates that surround it https://reblase.sibr.dev/game/ac68c433-9981-4264-83dc-1ba12f3b3fa4#376cdcee-379a-5c83-d0e0-12cd138f4498
